# DiscordBot For Numbskull Studios

This bot serves as a little helper for the Numbskull Studios Discord Server.

The repo is public so some of the cool code (like accessing the HacknPlan API) can be shared.
However, it's not recommended to clone this repo yourself and try to make it work.
If you like the code, just copy and paste it into your own project.

Things this bot does:
- Convert HacknPlan task IDs (#500) into Discord Embeds with info like users, tags and description
- Create HacknPlan tasks
- Copy images marked with !art into a dedicated archive channel
- Some other stuff!
